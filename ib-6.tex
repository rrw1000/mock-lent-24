You have been given a CPU design which contains a 16-entry rotating register file and an ALU.
Each instruction for a subset of this design contains four 4-bit fields, A, B, C and D,
and a three-bit function field, F.

On each instruction:

\begin{itemize}
\item Latch the registers given in fields A and B into the ALU
\item Copy the result of the previous ALU operation into the register given by C
\item Rotate the register file forward (0->1, 1->2 .. 15->0) by D steps.
\item Perform the ALU operation F (whose result will be available for the next instruction)
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item What other operations would you require to make a general purpose CPU? \fullmarks{3}
\item Draw a block diagram for a reasonably efficient implementation of this architecture. Give the latency and IPC of your design. \fullmarks{5}
\item 

\end{enumerate}
