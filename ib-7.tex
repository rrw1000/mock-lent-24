  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Describe how strings are stored in C \fullmarks{2}
  \item Strings are often repetitive and so we would like to compress them. Write code (and interface functions) in C++ which implements run-length encoded strings. Remember to provide both sequential and random access. \fullmarks{10}
  \item Strings are often similar. Extend your implementation to allow common parts of strings to be stored just once \fullmarks{6}
  \item What storage management problem did your answer to (c) create? How did you fix it? \fullmarks{2}
  \end{enumerate}
