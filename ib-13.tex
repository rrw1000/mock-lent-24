  \begin{enumerate}
  \item In the context of automatic theorem proving, provide one-sentence definitions of each of the following concepts: {\em satisfiable}, {\em sound}, {\em complete}. You may take as given the definitions of all underlying concepts. \fullmarks{3}
  \item You have been given a resolution theorem provider with the following errors. For each error, describe, with justification, the consequences of the error.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item A literal is deleted from a clause \fullmarks{1}
    \item An entire clause is deleted \fullmarks{1}
    \item The occurs check of unification is not performed \fullmarks{1}
    \end{enumerate}
  \item For each of the following sets of clauses, either exhibit a model or show that none exists. $a$ and $b$ are constants, $x$ and $y$ are variables
