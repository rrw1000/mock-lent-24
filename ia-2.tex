\begin{enumerate}
\item Illustrate the operation of an R-S transparent latch, with a diagram. \fullmarks{2}
\item Now give a diagram of a D type master-slave flip flop. Why use a master-slave flip-flop rather than an R-S latch? \fullmarks{3}
\item
  The Fibonacci series has the properties:

\begin{itemize}
\item The first two elements of the series are 1 1
\item The nth term of the series, $F(n) = F(n-1)+ F(n-2)$
\end{itemize}

Design a state machine to produce the first 7 elements of the Fibonacci sequence over and over again (1 1 2 3 5 8 13 1 1 .. ) \fullmarks{10}
\item Either make your state machine self-starting, or prove that it already is. \fullmarks{1}
\item Give a block diagram for a circuit which can generate a similar sequence of all Fibonacci numbers less than $2^{32}$ and explain its operation \fullmarks{4}
\end{enumerate}
